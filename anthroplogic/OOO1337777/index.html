  <p><b>Dictionary.</b> What is the dictionary definition of "theft" ? <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/theft">https://www.thefreedictionary.com/theft</a> says :</p>
  <ul> <li> <i> The <b>unlawful taking</b> of the property of another </i> </li>
    <li> <i> the <b>dishonest taking</b> of property belonging to another person with the intention of depriving the owner permanently of its possession </i> </li>
    <li> <i> the act of <b>taking</b> something from someone <b>unlawfully</b>; </i> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The main words here are <i> "unlawful taking" </i> , <i> "dishonest taking" </i> . Therefore the words <i> "unlawful" </i> , <i> "dishonest" </i> says the same as <i> "to tell lies" </i> , <i> "to falsify" </i> ; and the words <i> "taking" </i> signify something as <i> "taking by force" </i> ( <i>"sudden/active force"</i> ) . But this <i> "force" </i> element need not be <i>"sudden/active force"</i> , such as to take someone's purse . This <i> "force" </i> element may be more  <i>"slow/passive force"</i> , such as to print money and therefore <i> "to convert the proportion" </i> of possession. The legislation definition will address this contrast .  </p>

  <p><b>Legislation.</b> What is the legislation definition of "theft" ? <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec322subsec1">https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec322subsec1</a> , at "Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 / PART IX — OFFENCES AGAINST RIGHTS OF PROPERTY [321 - 378] / THEFT [322 - 334]" , says :  </p>
  <p> <i>322 (1) Every one commits theft who <b>fraudulently</b> and <b>without colour of right</b> <b>takes, or</b> fraudulently and without colour of right <b>converts</b> to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent</i>
<ul> <li><i> (a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;</i></li>
<li><i> (b) to pledge it or deposit it as security;</i></li>
<li><i> (c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or</i></li>
<li><i> (d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.</i></li> </ul> </p>
  <p>And as expected , the main words here are <i> "fraudulently" </i> ( which says the same as <i> "unlawful" </i> , <i> "dishonest" </i> , <i> "to tell lies" </i> , <i> "to falsify" </i> ) , and  <i> "takes or converts" </i> .  </p>
  <p>Moreover the legislation , mentions <i> "without colour of right" </i> . This signify that although the suspect may believe to have <i> "colour of right" </i> ( =  <i> "expected morality" </i> , = <i> "expected justification" </i> ) , the reality is that the suspect is <i> "without colour of right" </i> ( = <b> "fool" </b> ) . For example , the suspect may believe the ambiguous/confused statement <i> "the nights repeat twice each day" </i> for indirect calculations , instead of choosing to see the direct reality . </p>
  <p> In short , "absence of truth/reality/actuality/be" or "bad logic" can be rephrased as : <b> forced-fool-and-theft/lie/falsification </b> </p>

  <p><b>Logic.</b> The ends is to compose/sequence two functions when the output of the first function is not included within the input of the subsequent functiion . The solution is : to intersec the input of the first function (so that its output is) within the input of the subsequent function .

<p>How to express that the output of the first function is NOT the same as the input of the subsequent function ?</p>

<p>Solution : by generalizing from the idea of function to the idea of function with reindexed/restricted/multiplied input : [ B_ <--b-- B --g--> C ] . Now the restriction function [b] should be <b>read backward</b> , and the effectful function [g] should be <b>read forward</b> . </p>

<p> Therefore any function can be read forward (the effectful orientation) or read backward (the reindexer/multiplier orientation). Here is the composition/sequencing of two functions when read backward : </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="composition_graph.svg"></p>

<p>  The question now is : how to compose/sequence two reindexed functions ( functions with reindexed/restricted/multiplied inputs ) such as (a <o> f) then (b <o> g) ? In other words : when the ouput of the first effectful function [f] may NOT be the same as the input of the subsequent effectful function [g] ? This is more complex than simply sequencing the effects , and shall be described in two steps . </p>

<p>Here is the initial step. When the ouput of the first function is NOT the same as the input of the subsequent function , then the inputs of first function must be restricted/intersected such that the corresponding outputs of the first function fall within the input of the subsequent function .</p>

<p>The first function is "transported" ( "pullback" ) against the input of the subsequent function ; the restricted inputs of this transported first function is named "intersection" .</p>

<p>This transport process is the initial step and can be described on its own now , and the final step which is named transporting-composition will be described later .</p>

<p>Here is the final step of composing two (general) reindexed functions . The transporting-composition makes use of the transport process to restrict/multiply the first effectful function [f] againt the input multiplier [b] of the subsequent function [g] ; then this transporting-composition simply composes their transported first effectful function [transp f] with the subsequent effectful function [g] to obtain [transp f o> g]. <p>
<p>  ( Moreover , if the input of the first function was somehow already restricted/multiplied via [a] , then this old restriction/multiplication [a] shall be composed/sequenced after the new restriction/multiplication [mult b] from this transport process ) </p>

<p><b>The bottom line is : to compute/eliminate/normalize the transporting/pullback-composition is rephrasable/reducible as to compute/eliminate/normalize the (common) composition in the presence of transports/pullback ... </b></p>

<p><b>Dictionary.</b> What is the dictionary definition of "majority" ? <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/majority">https://www.thefreedictionary.com/majority</a> says :</p>
<ul> <li> <i> The greater number or part; a number more than half <b>of the total</b>  </i> </li>
  <li> <i> the greater number or part <b>of something</b>  </i> </li>
  <li> <i> (elections) more than half <b>of the votes</b>  </i> </li>
</ul>

<p>The expression <b> "of ..." </b> refers to the <b>intersection</b> of the number with some explicitly totality/domain . The totality/domain is determined by such parameters as : space ( "where" ) , time ( "when" ) , end-goals ( "for what" ) .</p>

<p>Imagine that two counters in the number are mentality-neighbors ( same "where" , environment ) , or are synchronizing/colluding/conniving ( same "when" ) , or are interdependent ( same "for what" ) , then effectively/sensibly these two counters should merge as one counter , although formally/grammatically they are two distinct indexes for touching the same sensible counter . In short : it is possible to form/write the weighted (multiplied/fibered) intersection , as contrasted from effective/sensible majority ( which cancels-out multiplicity/"tribalism" ) ...</p>

<p><b>Legislation.</b> Each clause in some law/rule of the legislation may be viewed as determining more precisely some totality/domain of application . But is it possible to find therein or in practice such fools as "singleton-class" ?</p>

<p>In short : <b>"singleton-class" = </b> fabricating/falsifying some law/rule/grading/class which or its complement contains only some effectively-singleton target-individual , such to maximize this individual or correspondingly to obstruct this individual , or when the class becomes (unspoken) intersection-of-more-classes in the effective totality/domain and such is worse .</p>

<p>This last phrase says that the effective totality/domain may cause some hidden assumptions , such that the class becomes (unspoken) intersection-of-more-classes . The technical idea to express this situation is to say that : transporting some function against the identity function produces the same function . </p>
